            Since last year, Michael has been working at a financial services firm in New York as a member of their Technology Infrastructure organization, and Eric has been working at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts as a member of their Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering department. With these commitments, we are no longer able to provide the same focus to Shore Computers as we have in previous years, and we've decided that it's in the best interests of our clients to move on.<br/><br/>
            Over the last year or so, we have been reducing the number of web development projects we take on and have been transferring many existing projects to some of our partners. If you need a referral for a web designer or developer, please contact us. We have many people we've worked with over the years whose work we can recommend.<br/><br/>
            Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have. We will be striving to make this as smooth of a transition as possible over the next month. Again, thank you for your business over the years and we look forward to seeing you all again soon.<br/><br/>
